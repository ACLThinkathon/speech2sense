Agent: Hello, thank you for calling ShopFast Support. My name is Priya. How can I help you today?
Customer: Hi, I ordered a laptop two weeks ago and it still hasn’t arrived. Your website said 3–5 business days.
Agent: I’m very sorry for the delay. Could you please share your order number so I can check the status?
Customer: Sure, it’s #SF123456.
Agent: Thank you. I see the order was delayed at the courier’s end due to a routing error. I truly apologize for the inconvenience.
Customer: That’s not acceptable. I needed it for work. Why didn’t anyone inform me?
Agent: I understand your frustration. I’ll file a formal complaint on your behalf and escalate the shipping issue. Would you like me to expedite a replacement?
Customer: Yes, please. And I want a refund on the shipping fee.
Agent: I’ll submit a refund request for the shipping fee and confirm once the replacement is dispatched.
Customer: Alright. I hope this gets resolved quickly.
Agent: I’ll prioritize it. You’ll receive an update within 24 hours. Thank you for your patience.
